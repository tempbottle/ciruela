Ciruela Changes by Version
==========================


.. _changelog-0.6.8:

Ciruela 0.6.8
-------------

* Feature: command-line prints public keys used for signature to stderr before
  upload. This makes it easier to debug keys mismatch.


.. _changelog-0.6.7:

Ciruela 0.6.7
-------------

* Feature: add ``ciruela put-file`` command that adds/replaces a single file
  in the target directory.
* Feature: add old image identifier support in ``ciruela sync --replace``
  (and rust API) which means we can do (limited version of) atomic updates to
  the directory.
* Feature: ``ciruela edit`` now fails if directory was changed a remote system
  while you were editing a file (same failure applies for ``put-file`` too)
* Bugfix: when all discovered hosts have no config ciruela finishes with
  rejection instead of waiting indefinitely
